# Tastemap  (In progress)
I'm definitely a foodie.

When I travel, I usually plan my trip to special local restaurants by watching videos of food tour youtubers. 

But watch hours of youtube videos to find a good restaurants is a time consumuing task

So I'm making this web app to show restaurants that my favorite food youtubers has been to.
